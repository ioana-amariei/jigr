        <h2>About the game</h2>
        <p style="font-size:large;">
            This Web application allows solving puzzles proposed by the program or defined by users.
            Each player will be able to select - locally or remotely via a URL - an image that will be cropped at
            runtime into fragments as complicated as possible.
            The pieces will be mixed, the shifts / swings can be performed via drag & drop operations.
            The application will also provide support for snap placement in the right area.
            The current status of each puzzle can be saved locally with the possibility of subsequent restoration.
            The game can also be played offline (directly in the Web browser without the need for Internet access).
